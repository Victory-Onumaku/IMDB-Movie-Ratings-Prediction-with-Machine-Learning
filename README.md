# In this project, we are going to use machine learning models to predict IMDB ratings of any particular movie. This is going to be a regression problem.

# Here are the typical steps taken in this machine learning project for predicting IMDB ratings:<br>

# 1. Defined the Problem:
  We clearly defined the problem we want to solve. In this case, it's predicting IMDB ratings. 

# 2. Gathered Data:
  we collected relevant data for this project. This could include information about movies, director name, duration and other features that might influence IMDB ratings. 

# 3. Explored and Understood the Data:
     Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset. Checked for missing values, outliers, and patterns in the data. 

# 4. Data Visualization:
     Used seaborn and matplotlib for visualization of the data.

# 5. Preprocessed the Data:
     Handled missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and perform any necessary data transformations to prepare the data for machine learning models. 

# 6. Feature Engineering:
     Created new features to improve the performance of the machine learning model. 

# 7. Splitted the Data:
     Divided the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. 

# 8. Selected a Model:
     Choosed a machine learning algorithm suitable for regression tasks. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms. 

# 9. Trained the Model:
     Use the training data to train the selected model. The model learns the patterns in the data to make predictions.

# 10. Tune Hyperparameters:
    Optimized the model by tuning hyperparameters. This involves adjusting parameters that are not learned during training to improve performance. 

# 11. Evaluate the Model:
      Use the testing set to evaluate the model's performance. Common evaluation metrics for regression tasks include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
